        <p className="mt-4 text-lg text-gray-700">
          <strong>South Florida Simchah Initiative</strong> exists to bring joy back home.
          For too long, families have felt pressured to travel up north to “Takanah” halls
          for weddings and bar/bat mitzvahs—adding cost, stress, and distance from loved ones.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
          We believe simchos should be <strong>local, affordable, and dignified</strong>—without
          compromising on elegance, tradition, or halachic integrity. Partnering with venues,
          vendors, and community leaders, we’re building complete celebration packages so you
          can host beautiful, meaningful events right here in South Florida.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-gray-700">
          Our mission is simple: <strong>Keep the simchah in the community. Save families money.
          Strengthen our local Jewish life.</strong>
